# ComfyUI pi-Flow Nodes for Fast Few-Step Sampling

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakonik/piFlow/refs/heads/main/assets/teaser.jpg" alt=""/>


**ComfyUI-piFlow** is a collection of custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that implement the pi-Flow few-step sampling workflow. All images in the above example were generated using pi-Flow with only 4 sampling steps.

[pi-Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974) is a novel method for flow-based few-step generation. It achieves both high quality and diversity in generated images with as few as 4 sampling steps. Notably,  pi-Flow’s results generally align with the base model’s outputs and exhibit significantly higher diversity than those from DMD models (e.g., [Qwen-Image Lightning](https://github.com/ModelTC/Qwen-Image-Lightning)), as shown below.

In addition, when using some photorealistic style LoRAs, pi-Flow produces better texture details than DMD models, as shown below (zoom in for best view).

## Installation

**This repo requires ComfyUI version 0.3.64 or higher**. Make sure your ComfyUI is up to date before installing.

### ComfyUI Manager

If you are using [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager), you can load a [workflow](#workflows) first, and then install the missing nodes via ComfyUI Manager.

### Manual Installation

For manual installation, simply clone this repo into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
```bash
# run the following command in your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory
git clone https://github.com/Lakonik/ComfyUI-piFlow
```

## Workflows

This repo provides text-to-image [workflows](workflows) based on Qwen-Image and FLUX.1 dev. 

### pi-Qwen-Image

Currently supports the Qwen-Image text-to-image base model (and possibly some of its customized versions). Qwen-Image-Edit may be supported in the future.

Please download the image below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the pi-Qwen-Image workflow.

#### Adapter strength

Increasing `adapter_strength` in the loader node can reduce noise and enhance text rendering. This may be helpful especially when using a customized base model or additional LoRAs.

#### Sampler steps

The 4-step adapter works well for any number of sampling steps greater than or equal to 4.

### pi-Flux

Currently supports the FLUX.1 dev text-to-image base model (and possibly some of its customized versions).

Please download the image below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the pi-Flux workflow.

#### Adapter strength

Increasing `adapter_strength` in the loader node can amplify contrast, reduce noise, and enhance text rendering.

#### Sampler steps

Use gmflux_k8_piid_4step.safetensors for 4-step sampling and gmflux_k8_piid_8step.safetensors for 8-step sampling. Using other settings may result in amplified or reduced contrast, which could be re-calibrated by adjusting the `adapter_strength`.

#### Guidance 

The adapters **only work with `guidance` set to 3.5**. Do NOT modify this value, otherwise the results will be very noisy.

## GGUF Loaders

To load GGUF models, please install the custom nodes in [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) first. 

Then, replace the `Load pi-Flow Model` node in the workflows with the `Load pi-Flow Model (GGUF)` node and select the corresponding GGUF model file.
