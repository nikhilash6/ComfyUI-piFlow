# ComfyUI Nodes for AsymFlow and pi-Flow

**ComfyUI-piFlow** is a collection of custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that implement the following model families:
- **AsymFlow**
  <br>
  Generates realistic images in pixel space. 
  <br>
  **[[Workflows](docs/AsymFlow.md)]**

- **pi-Flow**
  <br>
  Fast few-step generation.

## Installation

**This extension (version 1.2.0 and above) requires ComfyUI version 0.17.0 or higher**. Older ComfyUI releases are no longer supported.

**Please uninstall any non-official AsymFlow or pi-Flow extensions before installing this extension**, as they may cause compatibility issues.

### ComfyUI Manager

If you are using [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager), you can load a [workflow](#workflows) first, and then install the missing nodes via ComfyUI Manager.

### Manual Installation

For manual installation, simply clone this repo into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
```bash
# run the following command in your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory
git clone https://github.com/Lakonik/ComfyUI-piFlow
```
